      <p>The Triple jump, also called hop, step, and jump, event in athletics (track and field) in which an athlete makes a horizontal jump for distance incorporating three distinct, continuous movements—a hop, in which the athlete takes off and
        lands on
        the same foot; a step, landing on the other foot; and a jump, landing in any manner, usually with both feet together.</p>
      <p>
        If a jumper touches ground with a wrong leg, the jump is disallowed. Other rules are similar to those of the long jump.
      </p>

      <p>The origins of the triple jump are obscure, but it may be related to the ancient children’s game hopscotch. It has been a modern Olympic event since the first Games in 1896; at those Games two hops were used, but one hop was used at the
        Olympics thereafter. (The standing triple jump was contested only in the 1900 and 1904 Olympics.)</p>

      <ol>
        <li>The Approach: <dfn>one of the most important parts of an athlete's jump. The athlete sprints down a runway to a takeoff mark, from which the triple jump is measured. The takeoff mark is commonly either a piece of wood or similar material
            embedded in the runway, or a rectangle painted on the runway surface.</dfn></li>
        <br />
        <li>The Hop: <dfn>begins with the athlete jumping from the take-off board on one leg, which for descriptive purposes, will be the right leg. Precise placement of the foot on the take-off is important in order for the athlete to avoid a
            foul.</dfn></li>
        <br />
        <li>The Step: <dfn>the athlete utilizes the backward momentum of the right leg to immediately execute a powerful jump forwards and upwards, the left leg assisting the take-off with a hip flexion thrust similar to a bounding motion. This leads
            to the step-phase mid-air position, with the right take-off leg trailing flexed at the knee, and the left leg now leading flexed at the hip and knee.</dfn></li>
        <br />
        <li>The Jump: <dfn> The step landing forms the take-off of the final phase (the jump), where the athlete utilizes the backward force from the left leg to take off again. The jump phase is very similar to the long jump although most athletes
            have
            lost too much speed by this time to manage a full hitch kick, and mostly used is a hang or sail technique.

            When landing in the sand-filled pit, the jumper should aim to avoid sitting back on landing or placing either hand behind the feet.</dfn> </li>
        <br />
        <li>Foul: <dfn>also known as a "scratch," or missed jump, occurs when a jumper oversteps the takeoff mark, misses the pit entirely, does not use the correct foot sequence throughout the phases, or does not perform the attempt in the
            allotted amount of time (usually about 90 seconds). When a jumper "scratches," the seated official will raise a red flag, and the jumper who was "on deck," or up next, prepares to jump.</dfn></li>

      <p>Equipment needed for the triple jump includes a runway and a takeoff board identical to those used in the long jump, except that the board is at least 13 metres (42.7 feet) from the landing area for men and 11 metres (36 feet) for women.</p>
