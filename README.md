# Art-Of-The-Triple
This repository contains the code to a documentation page for the Triple Jump. This was originally a FreeCodeCamp project that has turned into a bit of a passion project.


Origin: In HS, Track & Field was my everything. I had success early, so that only added to my focus, as I became accustomed to winning and wanted to maximize my potential.

I really spent a lot of time thinking about it, researching my event, watching videos of professionals; pondering on how to get better. Coach gave me workouts but I had extra workouts for myself at night.

Coaching: Last year (2021) I was given the opportunity to join the faculty of Booker T. Washington HS (Miami). I'd always had a desire to coach, however in Florida coaches are required to be employed by the school district. I had hoped to get into Education later in my career, however the opportunity arised to kill two birds with one stone (if you will).
The coaching staff was in flux, so considering my experience and affinity for jumping events, I was hired as an assistant coach, responsible for both girls & boys.

Purpose: This page is meant to serve as a resource for new and experienced jumpers. Here they will be able to find information in regards to the Triple Jump technique, training, equipment, etc.

Highlights: The videos and images aren't directly related to the purpose of the page. They're solely highlights from my first season in an offical coaching capacity.
